# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Parkinson's disease prediction model. The model is built using machine learning techniques to analyze specific symptoms and determine the likelihood of Parkinson's disease. The repository aims to provide a tool that can be integrated into a website application where users can input symptoms, and the model will use predefined symptom frequencies to deliver an accurate prediction.

## Key Features

- **Symptom Selection**: Allows users to select various symptoms commonly associated with Parkinson's disease.
- **Frequency-Based Detection**: Utilizes predefined symptom frequencies to categorize each symptom as high or mid-level, enhancing the modelâ€™s accuracy in detecting Parkinson's disease.
- **Minimum Symptom Requirement**: The model requires a minimum number of symptoms to be selected to ensure a reliable prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for integration into a website, making it accessible to a broader audience seeking preliminary Parkinson's disease assessments.
